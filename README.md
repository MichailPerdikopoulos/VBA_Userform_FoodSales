# VBA_Userform_FoodSales
VBA project - Userform 


Simple userform with mutliple features using data from: 'https://www.contextures.com/xlsampledata01.html'

The user can:

Add a sale - filling all the fields of the form<br /> 
Edit a sale - searching by valid sale ID number<br /> 
Add multiple sales - importing excel path and automatically adding all the data to the main database<br /> 
Create a report - filtering the data however the user wants and creating a simple report in a new sheet


For the purpose of this project almost every type of UserForms was used.

For better UI default buttons were avoided in the menu. Instead 2 self made images used, one simple one highlighted
